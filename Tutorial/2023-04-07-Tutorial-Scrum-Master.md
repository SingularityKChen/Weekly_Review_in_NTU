## Scrum Meetings

As a Scrum Master, you should ensure that the Scrum Team follows the Scrum framework and continuously improves. Below are the five key meetings in Scrum and your responsibilities in each:

### Sprint Planning

- Ensure that the Product Owner has a well-prepared and prioritized Product Backlog.
- Facilitate the discussion and help the team to understand the sprint goal and select items from the Product Backlog.
- Assist the team in breaking down Product Backlog items into manageable tasks and estimating the effort.
- Ensure that the team has a clear definition of "Done" and everyone agrees on it.

### Daily Stand-up

- Facilitate the meeting and ensure it's time-boxed (15 minutes).
- Make sure each team member answers the three key questions: What did they do yesterday? What will they do today? Are there any impediments?
- Help the team to identify and remove any impediments.
- Encourage communication and collaboration within the team.

### Backlog Refinement

- Ensure that the Product Owner is present and has a prioritized list of Product Backlog items.
- Help the team to clarify, estimate, and prioritize the Product Backlog items.
- Assist the team in identifying dependencies and risks.
- Encourage the team to ask questions and provide feedback to the Product Owner.

### Sprint Review

- Facilitate the meeting and ensure that all stakeholders are present.
- Help the team to showcase the completed work and gather feedback from the stakeholders.
- Assist the Product Owner in updating the Product Backlog based on the feedback received.
- Encourage open and constructive feedback from all parties.

### Sprint Retrospective

- Facilitate the meeting and ensure it's time-boxed (usually 1-3 hours).
- Help the team to reflect on the past sprint, discussing what went well, what didn't, and potential improvements.
- Guide the team in identifying actionable improvements for the next sprint.
- Ensure that the team leaves with a clear plan to implement improvements and track progress.

## Task Breakdown

To assist in task breakdown, follow these steps:

1. Understand the User Story: Ensure the user story is clear, concise, and follows the INVEST criteria.
2. Identify Subtasks: Guide the team in identifying necessary steps to complete the user story.
3. Estimate Effort: Help the team estimate the effort required for each subtask.
4. Collaborate: Encourage team members to collaborate and discuss their ideas.
5. Verify Completeness: Ensure that tasks cover all aspects needed to complete the user story.
6. Adjust as Needed: Be prepared to help the team revise and refine tasks as needed.

## Definition of Done

A good Definition of Done should:

1. Be Clear and Concise: Easily understood by all team members and stakeholders.
2. Be Agreed Upon: The entire team should agree on the DoD.
3. Be Measurable: Criteria should be objective and measurable.
4. Reflect Quality: Incorporate quality standards, such as code reviews, testing, and documentation.
5. Be Adaptable: Review and update the DoD as needed.

Example of a simple Definition of Done:

- Code is written and follows coding standards
- Code is peer-reviewed and approved
- Unit tests are written and pass
- Integration tests are written and pass
- Code is merged into the main branch
- Documentation is updated
- The feature meets the acceptance criteria outlined in the user story
