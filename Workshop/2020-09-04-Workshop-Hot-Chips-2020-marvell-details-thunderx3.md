Marvell here opted to evolve its own interconnect microarchitecture  which has now evolved from a simple ring design, to a switched ring with three sub-rings, or columns. Ring stops consist of CPU tiles with 4  cores and two L3-slices with 3MB of cache. This gives a full die with 15 ring stops (3x5 columns) and the full 60 cores 90MB of total L3 cache  which is a quite respectable amount.
