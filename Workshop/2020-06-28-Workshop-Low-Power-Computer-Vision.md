# tinyML Talks - Yung-Hsiang Lu: Low-Power Computer Vision[^1]

## Hierarchical Neural Networks

By utilizing hierarchical neural network, we can separate the big neural network into much small ones, hence reduce the training time and inference power consumption. However, it might increase the latency.

## The Existing Technologies for Making Computer Vision Energy-Efficient

This presentation also surveyed the existing technologies for making computer vision energy-efficient, including

1. parameter quantization  and pruning;
2. compressed convolutional filters and matrix  factorization;
3. network architecture search;
4. knowledge  distillation.
