# ESWEEK 2021 QuantumFlow

This tutorial is provided by Dr. Jiang Weiwen. This blog reference his previous tutorials[^1][^2] as the newest slides are not updated yet. I also tried to attaches some slides from YouTube[^3][^4].

## Introduction to Quantum Computing

### Qbit

Qbit is quantum bit. Different from the classical digital bit, which can only represent only one value per bit, Qbit can represent both $1$ and $0$ at the same time with different probabilities, *i.e.*, a n-Qbit value can represent $2^n$ values at the same time.

### Quantum Gates

As the graphs show, the classical one bit wire and NOT gate can be represented using matrixes.

As for multiple bit gates, there are also several quantum gates.

### Three representations of Quantum Values

I'll update this part once I obtain the tutorial slides.

## Useful Materials

You can find many courses in YouTube.

Besides, you can find a textbook from IBM Qiskit website[^5].
