# Turning Tax[^1]

This term is taught by Paul H J Kelly at IC London.

> The “Turing Tax” is a term for the overhead (performance, cost, or energy) of the universality of the universal computing devices.

Which I think are CPUs, GPUs, etc. 

> That is, the performance difference between **a special-purpose device** and **a general-purpose one**, 

The former one is also called DSA (domain special architecture).

> The Turing Tax is actually **the overhead bits due to the general-purpose** nature of the processor, in contrast to a special-purpose digital design.

## Instructions

Store instructions 

+ Fetch them
+ Decode them
+ Maintain PC
+ Handle branches
+ Predict branches
+ Handle branch mis-predictions

## Data routing

Forwarding is used to avoid stalls and is switched by multiplexors, which are determined by instruction decode.

In a special-purpose machine, we might not need all forwarding paths, or not need to switch them, or might place the producer and consumer adjacently, so the wires can be shorter.

## Register access

Instructions use registers to pass values from one operation to the next. Each time a register is used, we have to look the value up in the register file.

In a special-purpose machine, we’d use a piece of wire.

## Configurable ALU

The ALU function is controlled by a signal derived from decoding the instruction, and is a multipurpose unit – that can add, subtract, multiply etc.

In a special-purpose design we would only have **the units we need** and we’d have just **the right number of each kind**.
