# 2.5D and 3D Interposer

## Introduction[^1]

Interposers are wide, extremely fast electrical signal conduits used between die in a 2.5D configuration. They can be made of both silicon and organic materials.

The upside is that the interposers provide a much larger channel for electrical signals, reducing the amount of energy needed to drive those signals, minimizing resistance/capacitance (RC) delay, and shortening the distance between various IP blocks in a system and the memories associated with them. Current interposers incorporate through-silicon via for transmission of signals.

## Structure

Below is the structure of 2.5D circuit with a interposer.

And the figure below compares the difference of 2.5D chip and 3D chip.
