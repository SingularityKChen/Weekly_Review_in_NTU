# Two Terms for Timing Analysis: WNS and TNS

WNS: worst negative slack, the worst slack value, characterizes the worst performance of the chip.

TNS: total negative slack, the sum of all negative slack values, represents a performance range of the chip.

It is an index to measure the degree of timing, usually a negative number. The more negative, the worse the performance.
