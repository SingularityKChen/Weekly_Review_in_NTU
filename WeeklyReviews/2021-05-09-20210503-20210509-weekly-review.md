Last week, I finished my last exam and then mainly worked on the 3D Chip Architecture.

It took me almost one and a half days to drawing the Architecture Graph and two days for the task mapping Excel. However, I can not say that I I had already finished all the details.

I also spent some time helping my friend debugging integration project T.

For the first half of this week, I have to work on the 3D Chip Architecture while the next half I have to finish the conference slides.

What a busy week!
