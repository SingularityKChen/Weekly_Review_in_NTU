Last week, I submitted the conference slides and also thought the outlines for project P. I found that my habit of doing slides when the projects are going helps me to save my time when I need to write the paper or report. I also began to write the draft paper of project P.

However, I didn't have time to think deeply on 3D architecture as well as my annual progress report.

This week, I need to focus on the draft paper of project P and also 3D architecture.
