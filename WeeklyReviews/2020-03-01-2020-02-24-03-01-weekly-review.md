This week I read a deep learning accelerator survey "A Survey of Accelerator Architectures for Deep Neural Networks" and gave a presentation related to it with some more details from Sze's 2019 presentation.

Also, I tried to generate the random test data to test PE. I found a Scala library named `Breeze`, which contains almost all data types and operators needed to do convolution or `img2col` matrix multiply. But it need to be translated to standard Scala type such as `List` or `Array` and then it can be used as the data source of my `Chisel` test.

Plus, [Sequencer](https://github.com/sequencer) helped me to establish `mill` development environment and re-organize my project directories, hence now I can use `mill` instead of `sbt`.

## Chisel & Scala Syntax

### Breeze

[Breeze](https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze) is a library for numerical processing. I want to use `Breeze` to generate random dense or sparsity matrix and then get the golden results of convolution or matrix multiply.

[Here](https://blog.csdn.net/u012102306/article/details/53463388) is an api summary. To use `Breeze`, we need to add dependence in `build.sc` (in `mill`).

```scala
override def ivyDeps = Agg(
    ivy"other_dependences",
    ivy"org.scalanlp::breeze:1.0"
  )
```

### Replace `sbt` with `mill` in idea

After setup `build.sc`, then run this command in terminal at the project root directory to let the `idea` utilize mill:

```bash
mill mill.scalalib.GenIdea/idea
```
