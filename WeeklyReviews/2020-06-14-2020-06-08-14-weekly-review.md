This week, I began to learn the methodology of SystemC and its syntaxes. Also, I read some articles related to 3D convolution.

On Monday, I had a discussing with my supervisor, during which he told me a direction to work on. Later, I was introduced to one cool researcher who is working on the deep learning accelerating algorithm. Then I read two papers wrote by him.

I posted the followings this week:

+ [Different Abstraction Models](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/06/11/Different-Abstraction-Models/): basic knowledge of modelling.
+ [SystemC and Its Simulation Kernel](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/06/12/SystemC-and-Its-Simulation-Kernel/): components of SystemC.
+ [3D Convolution: kernel will traverse in 3-D](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/06/12/3D-Convolution/): basic concepts of 3D convolution.
+ [Entropy Coding and Tunstall Coding](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/06/14/Entropy-Coding-and-Tunstall-Coding/): basic concepts of entropy coding and Tunstall coding.
