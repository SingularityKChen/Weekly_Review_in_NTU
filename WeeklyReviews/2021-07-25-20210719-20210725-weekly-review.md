Last week, I began to work on the OSCPU project, which aims to design an RISC-V 64I CPU. I finished the very basic single-cycle CPU to decode `addi` instruction. I also tried to use their `daffiest` framework to test the function of the CPU. 

I also learned to use Python to generate Excel sheets to illustrate the data in each PE unit.

This week, I'll continue working on the OSCPU project and the deep learning accelerator.
