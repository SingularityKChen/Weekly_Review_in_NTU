This week, I worked on updating the paper and BPNN implementation in Chisel.

I wrote a Python script to auto-run another Python script which receives arg from the command line and then mine script also collects and analyzes the results from the executed Python script.

As for the BPNN accelerator, I finished the main part and left the activation function, as tanh is quite complex to implement in hardware and we are trying to replace the tanh with the very simple ReLu activation.

I also wrote a little bit convex optimization report, which I'll continue the next week.

I post one blog this week:

+ [ResNet-50 Architecture and # MACs](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2021/04/03/Glean-ResNet-50-Arch-And-MACs/): This posts shows the basic architecture of the ResNet-50 and the number of weights as well as the MAC operations.
