Last week, I finished the convex optimization report as well as the IR assignment 3: ranking algorithm.

I spent around one day to generate or update the data in the paper.

This week, I'll submit the camera ready paper and IR assignment 3 report. I also have to rewrite the simulation Pulpissimo C file for project T.
