This week, I still worked on the Loosely Timed TLM.

I do realize that either Chisel or Verilog is used to implement the design, while I need some rapid tools to verify my design's function and a coarse-grained performance results.

Chisel is a wonderful implementation tool under developed. I think I'll use it after the modelling in SystemC or Python(if any) as a academic implementation codes.

As for the modelling, I found that currently, I just simply write the pure C++ code as small compute units while only use SystemC for the communications between the second-level top unit and memories.

But I think I can change those pure C++ function calls to SystemC control signals after the functional verification.

I posed two posts this week.

+ [Undefined reference to one function in CPP](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/08/04/Code-Study-CPP-undefined-reference/): one error occurred in the template C++ class.
+ [ANSI Escape Codes](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/08/06/Glean-ANSI-Escape-Codes/): you can use ANSI Escape codes to print colourful log information.
