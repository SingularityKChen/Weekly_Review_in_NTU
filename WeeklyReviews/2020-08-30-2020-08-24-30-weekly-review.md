This week, the accelerator model successfully simulated the first layer of MobileNet V2. I also took almost two days to write my research proposal.

I read one paper related to the instruction compression.

I posted these posts this week:

+ [Code bloat](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/08/25/Glean-Code-Bloat/): In computer programming, code bloat is the production of program code that is perceived as unnecessarily long, slow, or otherwise wasteful of resources.
+ [Using C++ Lib Chrono to record execution time](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/08/26/Code-Study-CPP-chrono/): Chrono is a flexible collection of types that track time with varying degrees of precision.
+ [Code compression for embedded VLIW processors using variable-to-fixed coding](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/08/26/Read-Paper-Code-compression-for-embedded-VLIW-processors-using-variable-to-fixed-coding/): In this paper, it introduces a compress method which uses variable-to-fixed coding schemes based on either Tunstall coding or arithmetic coding to overcome the communication bottleneck between memory and CPU, especially for RISC or VLIW processors, which have a code size bloating problem compare to CISC processors.
+ [Content-addressable memories](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/08/28/Glean-Content-addressable-memory/): Content-addressable memories (CAMs) are hardware search engines  that are much faster than algorithmic approaches for search-intensive  applications.
+ Hardware/Software Codesign: As the name implies, Hardware/Software Codesign (HSCD) denotes design methodologies for electronic systems that exploit the trade-offs and the synergy of Hardware (HW) and Software (SW).
