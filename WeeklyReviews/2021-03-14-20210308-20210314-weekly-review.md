Last week, I was working on the Pulpissimo simulation c file that control the CPU.

I was not familiar with C pointer's pointer but after one week's trying, I had a better understanding of the pointer's pointer as well as the 3D array.

For the Pulpissimo, I also understood that the CPU can access all the address of the program but if the program is too large, the TCDM may not access some data, in that case, we need to move the data outside particular area.

I also have finished the advanced computer architecture courses for the first time and plan to learn it again in the near future to handle it fully.
