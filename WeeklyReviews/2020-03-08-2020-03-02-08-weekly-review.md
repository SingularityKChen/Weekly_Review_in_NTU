# 2020/03/02-08

This week, I worked out the architecture details of `Eyeriss V2`, and I modified the logic of `ProcessingElement`, also separated `inAct` data connections and control logics out of PE Cluster top, making it more clearly and convenient for testing.

Plus, I modified this blog, separated all read papers.

I read two papers as well:

1. An efficient kernel transformation architecture for binary- and ternary-weight neural network inference
2. Hardware for Machine Learning: Challenges and Opportunities

## Chisel

```command
Connection between left (Bool(Wire in PECluster)) and source (Bool(Wire in PECluster)) failed @: Locally unclear whether Left or Right (both internal)
```

```scala
wireVec(i)(j) <> connectedWireVec((i + j + 2) % 3)
```

I connect wire with `<>`, so I need to change it with `:=`.

```
Connection between left (CSCStreamIO(Wire in WeightRouter)) and source (CSCStreamIO(OpResult in WeightRouter)) failed @.dataIOs.data.bits: Locally unclear whether Left or Right (both internal)
```

```scala
internalDataWire <> Mux(inSelWire, io.dataPath.inIOs(1), io.dataPath.inIOs.head)
```

We can change it with `when` condition.

```scala
  when (inSelWire) {
    internalDataWire <> io.dataPath.inIOs(1)
  } .otherwise {
    internalDataWire <> io.dataPath.inIOs.head
  }
```

The `MuxLookup` should change to `when` `elsewhen` `otherwise` too.

### `DecoupledDriver`

When I used `DecoupledDriver.enqueue`, I met this error.

We just need to `setSourceClock`.

```scala
theTopIO.dataStream.ipsIO.setSourceClock(theClock)
```

And `setSinkClock` is need for `ready` signal.

## Linux

### Tree

```
$singularity:~/chipyard/sims/verilator$ tree -L 2
.
├── generated-src
│   └── example.TestHarness.TinyRocketConfigTest
├── Makefile
├── simulator-example-TinyRocketConfigTest-debug

```

`tree -d`: 

`tree -L [number]`:
