Last week, I was mainly focusing on debugging project T with my friend and preparing for the final exams.

We fixed two hardware bugs as we didn't consider the details of the protocol in our hardware. And I also fixed one bug in my Python script caused by a missing `()` in the condition statement.

This week, I'll continue focusing on my final exams and will try to find some time slots to finish the BPNN fast.
