This week, I read the paper related to VLIW and learned the [TLM tutorial video](http://videos.accellera.org/tlm20tutorial/) by accellera.org. I watched one tinyML workshop video related to the optimization of computation and memory.

I think after reading the textbook "SystemC: From the Ground Up", then it's better to study via those tutorial videos and project examples.

I post these blogs this week:

+ [Tightly Coupled Memory](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/07/20/Glean-TCM/): the concepts of TCM and the difference between TCM and Cache.
+ [Very Long Instruction Word Architectures and the ELI-512](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/07/20/Read-Paper-VLIW-Architectures-and-the-ELI-512/): This paper introduces three problems that VLIW meets and the  corresponding possible solutions. I also posts the pros and cons of  VLIW.
+ [tinyML Talks: AIML SoC for Ultra-Low-Power Mobile and IoT devices](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/07/22/Workshop-AI_ML-SoC-for-Ultra-Low-Power-Mobile-and-IoT-devices/): This workshop introduces 
  + two computation optimization methods
    + Address Generation HW Unit
    + Pipeline architecture
  + three memory optimization methods
    + Dequantization
    + Entropy compression
    + Pooling on the fly
