This week, I read two papers, one is `Deep Learning Hardware: Past, Present, and Future`. I'll sift the main ideas the next week.

And I also tried to [do the exercise of SystemC](https://github.com/SingularityKChen/SystemC-Training/blob/master/Adder/exercises_adder.cpp).

I posted these blogs this week.
