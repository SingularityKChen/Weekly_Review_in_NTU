These three weeks, I posts four posts:

+ [Remove Empty File Folder](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2021/01/11/Glean-Remove-Empty-Folder/): introduces how to remove some empty folders. Also, introduces the commands `find` and `xargs`.
+ [Limitations of Current Verification Methods](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2021/01/11/Survey-Limitations-of-Current-Verification-Methods/): this survey is still in draft version. Introduces the limitations of current verification methods,  including formal verification, constrained random verification (CRV) and hardware-software co-verification using virtual platform with hardware  emulation and acceleration.
+ [State Explosion Problem and Formal Verification](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2021/01/13/Glean-State-explosion-problem-and-formal-verification/): the definition of State explosion problem and its challenges and solutions in formal verification.
+ [Functional Verification Cycle and Challenges](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2021/01/14/Glean-Functional-Verification-Cycle-and-Challenges/): This post introduces four phases in the functional  verification cycle and its four challenges to reduce time and improve  robustness at each stage. The corresponding solutions are mentioned as  well, which can be seen as the suitable situations for different  verification methodology.

I also tried to use Python to model the behavior of one hardware circuit. I think it's more convenient than SystemC. But the clock cycle and power performance can be a tough problem.
