# 2020/11/30-12/06

This week I read two papers and posted two posts:

+ [IoU and NMS](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/12/03/Glean-NMS/): introduction to Intersection over Union and Non-maximum suppression.
+ [MaxpoolNMS: Getting Rid of NMS Bottlenecks in Two-Stage Object Detectors](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/12/04/Read-Paper-MaxpoolNMS/): one paper published in cvpr19 provides a parallelizable alternative to the NMS algorithm.

I also practiced a little bit piano.
