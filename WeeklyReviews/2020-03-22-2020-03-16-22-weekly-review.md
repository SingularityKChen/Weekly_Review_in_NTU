# 2020/03/16-22

This week, I learned some materials related to SiFive TileLink and its chisel codes. Also, tried to test the PE Cluster of FYP. From Friday, I also discussed `Fuzzer.scala` with Sequencer, though we were puzzled by the function `GenMask`.

This week, I hope I could attach the `ClusterGroup` onto `TileLink`.

## Scala Syntax

### High-Order Function

Use the function as the input parameter or the output.

```scala
def singleThreadPokePeek(adrOrData: Int, peekCon: (Int, Int) => Boolean): Unit = {...}
def formerCon(row: Int, col: Int): Boolean = {
   val condition = (row + col) < inActRouterNum
   condition
}
singleThreadPokePeek(1, formerCon)
```

Just use `=>` to show it's a function.

### Regular Expression Patterns

```scala
import scala.util.matching.Regex

val numberPattern: Regex = "[0-9]".r

numberPattern.findFirstMatchIn("awesomepassword") match {
  case Some(_) => println("Password OK")
  case None => println("Password must contain a number")
}

val pattern = "^[a-z0-9._%\\-+]+@(?:[a-z0-9\\-]+\\.)+[a-z]{2,4}$"

val emailRegex = pattern.r // or new Regex(pattern)

emailRegex.pattern.matcher("tt@163.com").matches // true
```

If you just want to match a piece of string, then you can use `find()`.

## Chisel Syntax

### One Bug of Chisel `fork.withRegion`

When I wrote a test for a multi-read-write-IO, I need to use `fork.withRegion` to combine them together. However, sometimes, they will not work, such as the following situation:

```scala
  it should "resolve fork-in-fork" in {
    test(new PassthroughModule(UInt(8.W))) { c =>
      fork {
          fork {
              c.in.poke(42.U)
              c.clock.step()
          } .fork {
              c.clock.step()
              c.in.poke(70.U)
              c.clock.step()
          }
      }.fork.withRegion(Monitor) {
          fork.withRegion(Monitor) {
              c.in.expect(42.U)
              c.clock.step()
          } .fork.withRegion(Monitor) {
              c.clock.step()
              c.in.expect(70.U)
              c.clock.step()
          }
      }.joinAndStep(c.clock)
    }
  }
```

## Base Address and Offset

![](https://www.webopedia.com/FIG/ADDRESS.gif)

An address that serves as a reference point for other addresses. For example, a base address could indicate the beginning of a program. The address of every instruction in the program could then be specified by adding an offset to the base address. For example, the address of the fifth instruction would be the base address plus 5.
