Last week, I finished one implementation of one circuit in Chisel. I also learned **Impact Map** and **User Story Map** during the week.

I watched two ISSCC plenary recordings via YouTube.

I posted this post this week:

+ [Impact Map](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/09/17/Glean-Impact-Map/): The introduction of impact map and how to create an impact map.
