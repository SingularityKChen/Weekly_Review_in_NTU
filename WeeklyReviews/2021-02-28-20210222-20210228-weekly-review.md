Last week, I was working on the two projects as usual. I fixed the Python module in project P and simulated it. I compared the Python outputs with the golden software outputs, but I don't know how to measure their difference.

For project T, I fixed the variable address in the simulation C file. I timed the pointer by 4 times of `sizeof` the array, which is incorrect. And the actually number of element in the array should be one fourth of `sizeof` the array.

I think any modules related to the communication should always strictly follow the communication protocol instead of just follow the waveform.
