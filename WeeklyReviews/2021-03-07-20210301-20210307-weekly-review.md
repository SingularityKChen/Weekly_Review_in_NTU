Last week, I was focusing on my assignments. I learned Python performance analyzing and multiprocessing during this assignment.

I post two blogs last week:

+ [Python Performance Analysis](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2021/03/03/Code-Study-Python-performance-analysis/): This blog introduces Python memory and execution time analysis tools Memory Profiler and cProfile.

+ [Python Multiprocessing with Return Values Using Pool](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2021/03/05/Code-Study-Python-multiprocessing/): This post introduces multiprocessing in Python with return values from the child processing using Pool class.
