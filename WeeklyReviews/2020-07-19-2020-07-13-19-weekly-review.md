This week, I read the paper related to N3XT technology and read the textbook "SystemC: From the Ground Up". So I also post some more detailed blogs related to SystemC.

And I think one should just pick up that textbook rather than the course slides.

I post these blogs this week:

+ [The N3XT Approach to Energy-Efficient Abundant-Data Computing](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/07/14/Read-Paper-The-N3XT-Approach/): This paper introduces the framework of N3XT as well as its  evaluation methodology. It also mentions the RRAM endurance resiliency.
+ SystemC: From the Ground Up
  + [Overview of SystemC Components](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/07/17/Emulate-Overview-of-SystemC/): It introduces the module and hierarchy as well as the three stages of SystemC simulation.
  + [Structure Design Hierarchy](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/07/17/Emulate-Structure-Design-Hierarchy/): It introduces six approaches of design hierarchy.
  + [Syntaxes of SystemC](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/07/17/Emulate-Syntax-of-SystemC/): It introduces the different syntaxes of SystemC module and constructors.
  + [SystemC Communication Ports](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/07/18/Emulate-SystemC-Communication/): It introduces the communication ports in SystemC, port array, exports and shows all connectivity possibilities in SystemC as a handy reference.
