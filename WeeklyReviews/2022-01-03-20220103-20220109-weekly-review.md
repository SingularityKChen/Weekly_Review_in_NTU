Last week, I made one important decision: prepare for PMP to learn the basic of management.

As last week is the first week of year 2022, we conduced one summary meeting where we reviewed all the meeting notes from July, 2021 and collected all the pending tasks together. I found that although we had this kind of meeting notes, we didn't mark the exactly deadline for that and no review meeting every month. 

I'll give my QE presentation at the beginning of next month, so I made a draft version of the presentation slides last week.

I continued learn formal and architecture on Saturday.
