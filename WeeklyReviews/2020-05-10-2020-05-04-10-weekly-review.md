This week, I polished the Scala model and made it preliminary configurable. Also, I changed the architecture of my final thesis and polished some words.

I prepared for the TPT in NTU at weekends.

From next week on, I'll mainly prepare for the TPT and GRE test, polishing the thesis if needed. If I'm tied or so, I'll improve the Scala modelling test as well, such as writing a mapping function. 

## High Speed Cache

### [Different Indexed and Tagged Methods](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/107096130)

#### Virtual Indexed Virtual Tagged

Send virtual address to cache controller. If miss, then send the address to MMU(memory management unit) to translate it to physical address.

##### Ambiguity

If two different virtual address mapped to the same physical address, we call it **ambiguity**. Then if thread A uses 0x4000 to map 0x2000 in PA, thread B uses 0x4000 to map 0x3000 in PA, it will occurs error when changing thread A to B.

To avoid that, while we changing threads, we need to flush all the cache. However, it will causes many cache miss at each beginning, leading to low efficiency.

##### Alias

Alias means different virtual addresses with different index mapped to the same physical address. It will cause trouble while writing one virtual address and reading another.

#### Physical Indexed Physical Tagged

Each virtual address will be translated to physical address in MMU. It can avoid ambiguity and alias problems but cost more in hardware.

#### Virtual Indexed Physical Tagged

![VIPT](https://pic4.zhimg.com/80/v2-12969d6792ebc4b5256e1822ffde6caf_720w.jpg)

We can use virtual index to look for cache line, meanwhile MMU translates the virtual address. Then comparing the tags of cache line's and physical address's, we can know whether hit or miss.

##### How to solve VIPT Alias Problem

The indexes of different virtual addresses needed enjoy the same index. For example, 0x0000 and 0x2000 own the same index, 0x00, so even they are mapped to the same physical address, the value will not be stored in more than one cache line.

### [TLB(Translation Lookaside Buffer)](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/108425561)

A common 64-bit system will have four levels page table, named PGD, PUD, PMD, PTE.

TLB is used to shorten this lookup processing, which stores the physical addresses in the corresponding virtual address.

TLB is a VIVT cache without offset.

But to avoid ambiguity, we can add a address space id (ASID) to distinguish different treads' TLB. Then we don't need flush TLB each time.

Each time all ASIDs are assigned to one PID, then flush TLB, reassign the ASID.

If two threads using kernel space, where all threads share the same address, then it doesn't need to change the TLB. We can use non-global (bG) bit. If true, then TLB hits.

### [Cache and DMA Coherence](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/109919756)

![](https://pic1.zhimg.com/80/v2-5c8283dee4ca2cc45bf2dc81c24d50a8_720w.jpg)

If CPU writes the data in cache, and DMA wants to read the corresponding data in main memory, then it might reads the wrong data.

#### Nocache

Allocate one area in main memory acts as buffer (4KB minimal). But it will affect efficiency.

#### Software Control

+ DMA write back to DMA buffer(in main memory). Invalid All the caches related to the DMA buffer until writing finishes.
+ DMA read from DMA buffer. Before read, clean all the cache(write back the changged data). But avoid CPU changes the cache while DMA reading from DMA buffer.
