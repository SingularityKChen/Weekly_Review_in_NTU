# 2020/01/27-2020/02/02

This week I read a lot of materials related to the state-of-art chip architectures mainly from HPML 2019 and hot-chip 2019. Although the progress of FYP was a little slow this week, I figured out the dataflow and part of control logics of Eyeriss V2, which was rather tricky and time-costing, but does benefit for my next week's implementation. Also, I finished the translation of Chisel-Bootcamp chapter 3 from English to [Chinese](https://github.com/SingularityKChen/chisel-bootcamp/tree/zh_cn).

And next week, I'll back to the implementation of Eyeriss. And if I have time, I need to read the papers left weeks ago.

- Leverage all areas of expertise

#### DLA Co-design: 

**ML research:**

- Computational requirements for cutting-edge models.

- Input/output data feed rates

- Types of operations to accelerate

- Latency and bw requirements

- Trains without loss scaling, unlike float 16

- Latest computational requirements

**ASIC:**

- Small mantissa reduces multiplier power, area

**Software:**

- Proper flexibility and programmability

- Controllability

- Same dynamic range as float 32, same Inf/NaN behavior

**Compilers:**

- JIT code-gen & parallel IRs

**Systems:** 

- Power delivery, board space.

- Board layout

- Thermal limits

- Liquid cooling

**Data Center:**
