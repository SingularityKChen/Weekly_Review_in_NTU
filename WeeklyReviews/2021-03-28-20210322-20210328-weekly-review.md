Last week, I finished the Python Model in the third version of project P, and compare the outputs from the Python model with the golden results.

And I also finished the assignment 2 of IR, where I practiced my Python programming ability. I learned some details of the Python data type memory usage.

This week, I'll working on the implementation of a simple BP neural network, where the tough part is the activation function. I'll also try to use Chisel to implement it, where I'll learn more about the Fixed Point data type. In my previous Chisel projects, I just use the unsigned data type.
