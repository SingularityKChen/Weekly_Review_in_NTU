Last Week, I found [one blog](https://www.adityaagrawal.net/blog/architecture/matrix_multiplication) to introduce the data flows of GEMM. Generally speaking, there are three data flows:

+ Inner Product: `row x col => point`
+ Outer Product: `col x row => matrix`
+ Systolic Array

As for inner product, there are four different sub-data flows with different stationary and data reuse methodology.

I've stuck by Clint in OSCPU project for one week. And finally I found an official requirement for the Clint and its memory address.
