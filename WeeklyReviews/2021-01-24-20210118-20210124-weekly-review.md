Last week, I post five posts and update the [Current Verification Methods And Their Limited Situations](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2021/01/11/Survey-Limitations-of-Current-Verification-Methods/):

+ [Posit: A Potential Replacement for IEEE 754](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2021/01/18/Glean-Posit-Data-Format/): Introduce the type III Unum, Posit. Including its four parts, the computation of the real value and recommend exponent bits.
+ [Computer Architectures for Next Generation Applications](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2021/01/18/Glean-comp-arch-for-next-gen-applications/): It introduces three laws: Moore's law, Makimoto's wave, Bell's  law and design methods and optimizations for performance and power as  well as fragmented requirements in AIoT aging. These methods including  reducing data movements, reducing data precious, improve parallelism and agile hardware development.
+ [Python Matplotlib](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2021/01/22/Code-Study-Python-Matplotlib/): Using Python Matplotlib to draw graph and plot it in a function.
+ [Tomasulo Algorithm](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2021/01/24/Glean-Tomasulo/): Tomasulo Algorithm eliminate three kinds of hazard RAW, WAR and  WAW hazards by forwarding and renaming. The three stages of this  algotithm are issue, execute and write back.
+ [Turning Tax](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2021/01/24/Glean-Turing-Tax/):  It describes the overhead (performance, cost, or energy) of the  universality of the universal computing devices. It can be caused by instructions, data routing, register access and configurable ALU, where  we can reduce the Turning Tax.

I plan to write a post which introduce the Python modelling method.
