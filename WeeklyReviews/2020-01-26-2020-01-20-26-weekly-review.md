# 2020/01/20-26

This week I finished the draft implementation of Processing Element with partly verification. Now it works on most situations.

During the implementation, I found most of the time was cost on some logic details. And with the growth of the circuit scale, it can be more difficult for me to figure out which part of the logic causes the bug. That means I am supposed to work out not only the architecture of this module but also a more detailed implementation. 

So next week, I will try to work out the basic architecture of clusters.

## Scala & Chisel Syntax

### Scala Patton Match

```scala
object Test {
	 def main(args: Array[String]) {
			println(matchTest("two"))
			println(matchTest("test"))
			println(matchTest(1))
			println(matchTest(6))

	 }
	 def matchTest(x: Any): Any = x match {
			case 1 => "one"
			case "two" => 2
			case y: Int => "scala.Int"
			case _ => "many"
	 }
}
```

### grep

```shell
ls /home/singularity/dl_accelerator/test_run_dir/*/* | \grep "/\w\+.fir"
```
