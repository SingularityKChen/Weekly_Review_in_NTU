This week, I read one paper and read the SystemC example project *the Simple Bus*.

I post the following blogs this week:

+ [Systolic Arrays for VLSI](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/07/04/Read-Paper-Systolic-Arrays-for-VLSI/): This paper proposes new multiprocessor structures and parallel  algorithms for processing some basic matrix computations which are  capable of pipelining matrix computations with optimal speed-up.
+ [TLM API 1.0 in SystemC](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/07/03/Emulate-TLM-API/): The 7th lecture slides of SystemC by National Chiao-Tung University. TLM API 1.0 in SystemC. Including core interfaces and standard channels.
+ [Transaction Level Modeling in SystemC](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/06/29/Emulate-Transaction-Level-Modeling-in-SystemC/): The 6th lecture slides of SystemC by National Chiao-Tung University. This post descripts the timed TLM, including the three sets of master interfaces, two sets of slave interfaces.
