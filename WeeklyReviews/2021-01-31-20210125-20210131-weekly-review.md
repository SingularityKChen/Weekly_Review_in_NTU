Last week, I post four posts and update the [Current Verification Methods And Their Limited Situations](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2021/01/11/Survey-Limitations-of-Current-Verification-Methods/) again:

+ [Branch Strategy](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2021/01/29/Glean-Branch-Strategy/): Version control strategies, like TBD, Git-Flow, GitLab-Flow.
+ [Formal Signoff](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2021/01/29/Glean-Formal-Signoff/): This post introduces the reason and goal of formal signoff. Later seven steps of formal signoff based on Synopsys are listed.
+ [Linux aliases](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2021/01/30/Tutorial-Linux-alias/): Some useful Linux aliases.
+ [Python Hardware Behaviour Model](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2021/01/31/Tutorial-Python-Hardware-Behaviour-Model/): In this tutorial, I will try to help you understand how to write a Python hardware behaviour model.
