I also learned a little about the SystemC TLM quantum keeper, but didn't use it in my modelling as I didn't think I need it to sync the time."

This week, I still worked on the Loosely Timed TLM.

I'm a little knowledge the concept of memory cell and memory structure. I spent a lot of time on optimizing the memory structure.

I also learned a little about the SystemC TLM quantum keeper, but didn't use it in my modelling as I didn't think I need it to sync the time.

I post this read paper this week:

+ [C-LSTM Enabling Efficient LSTM using Structured Compression Techniques on FPGAs](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/08/11/Read-Paper-C-LSTM-Enabling-Efficient-LSTM-using-Structured-Compression-Techniques-on-FPGAs/): This paper introduce some methods to accelerate the LSTM targeted on FPGA. It main utilize two methods: Block-Circulant Matrix; smaller  coarse-grained pipelines with double-buffers.
