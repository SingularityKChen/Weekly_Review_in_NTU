# 2020/03/23-29

This week, I finished the implementation and test of `CSCSwitcher`, also, reread the `Fuzzer.scala`, and mimic it to add TileLink into my project. And I have finished the framework of the top lazy module.

Next week, I plan to finish the test and correct the implementation of Cluster Group, meanwhile finishing the middle-term report. And I will try to finish the test of Memory control module and correct the implementation logic of it.

## Scala && Chisel Syntax

### [Intersection, Union and Complement](https://alvinalexander.com/scala/union-intersection-difference-scala-sets/)

#### Sample Data

```scala
scala> val low = 1 to 5 toSet
low: scala.collection.immutable.Set[Int] = Set(5, 1, 2, 3, 4)

scala> val medium = (3 to 7).toSet
medium: scala.collection.immutable.Set[Int] = Set(5, 6, 7, 3, 4)
```

#### Intersection

```scala
scala> val i = low.intersect(medium)
i: scala.collection.immutable.Set[Int] = Set(5, 3, 4)
```

#### Union

```scala
scala> val uniq = low.union(medium)
uniq: scala.collection.immutable.Set[Int] = Set(5, 1, 6, 2, 7, 3, 4)
```

#### Complement

```scala
scala> val diff = low.diff(medium)
diff: scala.collection.immutable.Set[Int] = Set(1, 2)

scala> val diff = medium.diff(low)
diff: scala.collection.immutable.Set[Int] = Set(6, 7)
```

### ScalaDoc Tags

Scaladoc comments go before the items they pertain to in a special comment block that starts with a `/**` and ends with a `*/`.

#### Some common tags

| Tag            | Description                                                  |                     Number allowed                      |

| Format            | Tag example                                                  |

### Print Log Info with Color

```scala
println(Console.RED + s"[Error] there is no difference between reqList and respList" + Console.RESET)
```

`RED_B` means the background color. Remember to reset the console every time you use it.

It has the following colors:

+ BLACK
+ BLUE
+ CYAN
+ GREEN
+ MAGENTA
+ RED
+ WHITE
+ YELLOW

And can also use `UNDERLINED`, `BOLD` to give the log info some styles.

See [AIP document](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.9.1/scala/Console$.html) for more details.

### The width of `UInt` in `RegInit`

In my design, I forgot to assign the width of `UInt` in `RegInit`, so in the example:

```scala
private val vectorNumCounter = RegInit(0.U)
```

It only has one bit, so it can only count for zero and one.

```scala
private val vectorNumCounter = RegInit(0.U(lgVectorNum.W))
```
