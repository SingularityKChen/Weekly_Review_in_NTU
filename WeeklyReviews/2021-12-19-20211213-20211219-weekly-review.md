# 2021/12/13-2021/12/19

Last week, I mainly focused on the performance testing of ShapoolNMS using Chisel implementations. I fixed one bug. I also tried to analysis the score distribution after `log2`. My cooperates from ASTAR said maybe we can try to output float-point scores from `softmax` instead of fixed-point for better theoretically higher mAP.

I continued learn formal and architecture on Saturday.
