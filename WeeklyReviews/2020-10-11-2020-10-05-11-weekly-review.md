This week, I wrote [one blog](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2020/10/08/Code-Study-Chisel-in-Rocketchip-3-Bundle/) introduces one advanced Scala usage in Chisel named `Optional`.

So this week I just working on some integration works, during which I was thinking how to group the bundles (the ports) to make them reusable and inheritable.

At one time, I just grouped the bundles with data ports and control ports. Right now, I'm wondering whether group them with the different consumers would be better.

For instance, module `A` has two submodules `B` and `C`, I think maybe I could new bundles for the connections from `A` to `B`, from `A` to `C` and from `B` to `C`. 

However, if `A` has a parent module `P`, and also connections from other peer modules like `E`, then the ports of `A` should be `A` to `E`, `A` to `P`...
