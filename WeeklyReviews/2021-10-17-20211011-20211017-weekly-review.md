Last Week, I began to implement the DLA in Chisel and also wrote the draft version of QE abstract. I also tried to prepare the slides for ISSCC SRP 2022, which is quite new for me.

The abstraction is quite difficult for me as my works are kind of parallel.

I'll try to finish the RTL of the current DLA this week.
