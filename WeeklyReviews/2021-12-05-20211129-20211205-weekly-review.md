Last two weeks, I read some documents of `Verdi` about how to alias the values of the signals. I tried to contribute a little bit to `FIRRTL` to generate a `tcl` file to give aliases.

Besides, I helped my supervisor prepare some slides on his talk.

I also learned a little bit about UPF, which I'm still learning.

I re-read "Computer Architecture A Quantitative Approach" 6-th edition recently. I've already finished Chapter 1, appendix A and B.

As for the research projects, my 3-rd version of DLA is hanging, which might be the second tape out instead of the first tape out.
