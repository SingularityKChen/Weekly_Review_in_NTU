Last week, I submitted the camera ready paper and IR assignment 3 report, each costs nearly one day.

It really amazes me that I need spends near one whole day to draw the graph, and write the IR 3 report.

I talked with one pioneer in the compiler and hardware architecture on Monday. He inspired me to think and optimize the design in the compiler's view not just at the single module's view.

I also  rewrite the simulation Pulpissimo C file for project T on last Friday. I helped my colleague to find the bug in the hardware pingpong buffer on Friday evening and Saturdays morning.
