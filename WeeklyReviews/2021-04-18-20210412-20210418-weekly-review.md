Last week, I submitted the camera ready paper and IR assignment 3 report, each costs nearly one day.

It really amazes me that I need spends near one whole day to draw the graph, and write the IR 3 report.

I also  rewrite the simulation Pulpissimo C file for project T on last Friday. I helped my colleague to find the bug in the hardware pingpong buffer on Friday evening and Saturdays morning.
