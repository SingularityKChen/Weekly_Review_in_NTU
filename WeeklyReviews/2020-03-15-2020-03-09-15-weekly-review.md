# 2020/03/09-15

This week, I re-thought the data flow of `row stationary plus` \(RS+\) and tried to generate the right data for each ports.

After I figure out the truly data flow of `row stationary plus`, I thought we are supposed to call it `column stationary` as we can get one column of partial sum at Noc level and Global Buffer level.

## [Git Commit Types](https://github.com/pvdlg/conventional-commit-types)

How to commit a elegant git log can be found [here](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/34223150).

## Scala Syntax

### `List.init`

`List.init`: return the elements of the list except the tail.

### `List.flatten`

Use flatten to flat one dimension. 

### `List.collect`

```scala
list.zipWithIndex.collect {
  case (x,i) if i % 3 == 0 => x
}
```

### `List.exists` && `List.contains`

```scala
val result = m1.exists(y => {y % 3 == 0})
val result2 = m1.contains(5)
```

## Chisel Syntax

### `fork.withRegion`

Because the `fork`  likes the thread in Linux, each child run and generate data separately without any sharing. So if we want to `poke` in one child thread and `peek` at another thread, then we need to use `fork.withRegion` to let the compiler knows that they should sharing the information.
