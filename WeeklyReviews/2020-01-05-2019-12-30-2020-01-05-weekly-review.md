# 2019/12/30-2020/01/05

Last week, I only read one article which is the survey of QNN. Although I know how to utilize several QNN models to reduce the memory requirements and power consumption, I don't understand why those formulas work due to the lack of some basic mathematic knowledge in the neural network.

I took my main time and energy to write my initial stage's report of my final year's project. During that period, I recall the paper I read the past month and thought over my project in more detail. I thought I could start my project with the basic processing element and then read more paper to find something interesting and then optimize the design.

Also, before the new year, I created one new Linux virtual machine with Virtual Box. And after the new year, I downloaded the latest Chipyard project from GitHub and rebuilt the environment in both mine virtual machine and Shien's. Fortunately, the new environment works now.

And this week, I will try to read as many Song Han's papers as possible before his seminar, and then I will read some other papers [listed before](https://singularitykchen.github.io/blog/2019/12/22/2019-12-16-22-weekly-review/). I hope I could finish the translation work of chisel-Bootcamp module 3.6 before this Saturday. After that, I will begin the design of PE in my FYP.

## Some Terms

### Stackelberg Game

In the [MBAlib](https://wiki.mbalib.com/wiki/%E6%96%AF%E5%A1%94%E5%85%8B%E5%B0%94%E4%BC%AF%E6%A0%BC%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B) describes the meaning of it.

The **Stackelberg leadership model** is a strategic game in economics in which the leader firm moves first and then the follower firms move sequentially.

### Fog Computation
