# 2020/02/17-23

This week, I continued on the survey of ML4HPC and found several papers of Indiana University, which described the definitions of ML4HPC and its subcategories. Also, I finished the draft implementation of GLB cluster with some test.

## Chisel & Scala Syntax

### Pay Attention To

I made a mistake by mismatch the width of one register or IO, so the results can be wrong. And it took me a long and hard time to find this. I think I'd better assign the values explicit.

### Generate Random List

```scala
  def RandomDataGen(n:Int, dataWidth: Int): List[Int] = {
    var resultList: List[Int] = Nil
    while ( resultList.length < n ){
      val randomNum = (new Random).nextInt(pow(2, dataWidth).toInt)
      resultList = resultList:::List(randomNum)
      /*
      if( !resultList.exists( s=>s==randomNum )){
        resultList = resultList:::List(randomNum)
      }
      */
    }
    resultList
  }
```
