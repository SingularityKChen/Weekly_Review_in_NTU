Last Week, I found some Chinese materials to introduce Img2Col and Winograd algorithm to accelerate convolution and papers that contribute to them:

+ [Winograd algorithm](https://www.cnblogs.com/shine-lee/p/10906535.html) and https://blog.csdn.net/qq_32998593/article/details/86181663
+ [Img2Col algorithm](https://www.cnblogs.com/shine-lee/p/10775831.html)

For the OSCPU CPU project, I wrote the Cache framework and cpu-test via generated bin files.
