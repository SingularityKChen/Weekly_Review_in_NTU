Last week, I used Python to quickly verify my algorithm and its quite easy, especially reading from Excels and txt files.

This week, I picked up Chisel and finished one submodule of the project.

As these are heavily engineering works, I do think I need to learn some agile methods to boost my efficient and make my progress in the time table.
