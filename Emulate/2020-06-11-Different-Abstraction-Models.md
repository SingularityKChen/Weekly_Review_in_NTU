# Different Abstraction Models[^1]

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SingularityKChen/PicUpload/master/img/20200611195959.png)

## Specification Model – Functional View

+ The system functionality without implementation details
+ Data transfer is modeled by variable accessing without any concept of channel

## Component-Assembly Model – Architectural View

+ Allocation of concurrent processing elements and mapping of processes
+ Data transfer is achieved by message passing channels
+ Message-passing channels
  + An abstract implementation of communication focusing on data transaction
  + No cycle-accurate, pin-accurate details, and no specific bus protocol

## Bus Arbitration Model – Architectural View

+ Channels between PEs are realized by an abstract bus
  + Require design decision in both computation and communication
+ An abstract bus
  + Data transfers are still implemented by message passing
  + Bus protocol is simplified as blocking and non-blocking I/O
  + Arbiter is required to resolve bus conflicts
  + No cycle-accurate, pin-accurate details

## Bus Functional Model – Micro-architectural View

+ Abstract bus channel is inline with a cycle-/pin-accurate protocol channel
  + Wires of the bus are instantiated with variables/signals
  + Data transfer follows the time/cycle-accurate sequence
  + Provide interface functions for all abstract bus transactions
  + Wrappers convert data transfer from higher level of abstraction (PEs) to lower level of abstraction (Protocol Channel)

## Cycle-Accurate Computation – Micro-architectural View

+ The PEs are cycle- and pin-accurate
  + Dedicated hardware IPs are modeled at register transfer level
  + Programmable processors are modeled by instruction set simulator
  + Wrappers convert data transfer from higher level of abstraction (abstract bus) to lower level of abstraction (PEs)

## RTL Model – Pure Micro-architecture View

Both computation and communication are pin- and cycle-accurate

## From Specification to Micro-architecture

### Component Assembly

+ Based on the algorithm analyses, we perform the following tasks
+ Partition the algorithm into SW/HW tasks
  + Select general purpose CPU or DSP based on the SW characteristics
  + Choose RTOS if necessary
+ Design IPs or select IPs from library according to the HW tasks
  + Define the functionalities of each IP
  + Define the interfaces and the data to be exchanged between IPs
  + Estimate functional delays in IPs

### Communication Exploration

+ Decision of interconnect structure 
  + Back-door connections or centralized buses
  + Assign bus-accessing properties for each IP (master or slave)
  + Decide the bus arbitration policy
+ Estimate functional delays in communication

### Protocol Refinement

+ Inline abstract bus with protocol channel
  + Determine the pin- and cycle-accurate bus protocol
  + Work out the details of the bus control signals
+ Wrappers are used to bridge the models of different abstractions
+ Extract delays in communication from micro-architecture

### IP Refinement

+ The IPs are refined to pin- and cycle-accuracy
+ Delays in computation are extracted from micro-architecture
+ The embedded SW is optimized to achieve real-time performance

### IP Replacement

+ Some IPs are modeled with pin- or cycle-accuracy
  + The IPs are replaced or refined one by one
+ Wrappers are used to bridge the models of different abstractions

### Communication Refinement

+ Inline abstract bus with protocol channel
  + Determine the pin- and cycle-accurate bus protocol
  + Work out the details of the bus control signals
+ Extract delays in communication from micro-architecture
+ Wrappers are used to bridge the models of different abstractions
