# Untimed TLM in SystemC[^1]

## Untimed TLM â€“ Data Flow Modeling

+ Purposes
  + Create initial draft of the specification model
+ Focus
  + Data flow and functionality modeling
+ Kahn process network
  + Deterministic, untimed model of computation
+ How?
  + Untimed processes are modeled with `SC_THREAD`
  + Processes communicate through FIFO channels using blocking read/write
  + Implicit system synchronization is achieved by the blocking read/write
    + Blocking read is suspended until data is available in the FIFO channel 
    + Blocking write is suspended until more space is available in the FIFO channel

## A Simple Adder

### Dead Lock

+ Missing **initial values** of the feedback channel
  + The adder would never be able to read from its first input
+ Unbalanced production and consumption rate in a feedback loop
  + A producer and a consumer connected to a FIFO channel need to move the same number of tokens on the average
  + If `DF_fork` produces two values on each output for every data sample consumed, the simulation would stall with the folk module attempting to write to its first output port
+ A quest for empty and full FIFOs can help to identify the causes
  + Access suspicious FIFOs after returning from `sc_start()`

### FIFO Sizes

+ FIFO sizes play a key role
  + Determine whether a system deadlocks
  + Have an impact on system behavior (value sequences)
  + Have an impact on simulation speed
+ Larger sizes cause less context switches and faster simulation

### Insertion of Functional Delay

+ Inserting functional delay in untimed TLM can be achieved by annotating the delay with `wait` statements
+ `SC_THREAD` is more preferable than `SC_METHOD`
  + Adding delay information in method processes is nontrivial
  + Maintaining blocking read/write semantics in method processes is next to impossible

### Stopping Untimed TLM Simulation

+ Simulation time will never advance in a purely untimed TLM
  + Processes are simulated with advance of delta-cycles
  + Using `sc_start` with a positive argument does not lead to the termination of the simulation
+ How can one terminate the simulation?
  + Solution I
    + Use process termination and hope for data backlog
      + Simulations are run until a sufficient amount of samples are obtained
      + Example: the `print_process` of the `DF_printer` module
    + It is not guaranteed to be successful
      + The process may be in some dead branch of the system
    + There could be multiple instances of `DF_printer`
      + Logic and-combination of exit conditions is a must
  + Solution II
    + Simply indicate the fact and continue to consume data
    + Create a terminator module and monitor different exit conditions
  + Combination of a given simulation time and data-dependent exit conditions can often be the best solution
